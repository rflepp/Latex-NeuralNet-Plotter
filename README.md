# U-Net Variation Architecture Visualization

The following example shows the **SplitterUNet** architecture used in the paper:  
[**Real-World Mobile Image Denoising Dataset with Efficient Baselines** (CVPR 2024)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Flepp_Real-World_Mobile_Image_Denoising_Dataset_with_Efficient_Baselines_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf)
Due to the plot's complexity this example usage might be interesting to readers.

This visualization is created using the excellent **[PlotNeuralNet](https://github.com/HarisIqbal88/PlotNeuralNet/tree/v1.0.0)** library by [Haris Iqbal](https://github.com/HarisIqbal88).
